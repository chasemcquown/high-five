## 💾Installation

To install this code, download the zip file, or use GitHub's guidelines to clone the repository. Also, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a text editor, I would recommend Visual Studio Code. . Once you have Node.js installed, then install Node Package Manager(npm) and a few dependencies such as Express, Handlebars and Sequelize. 

`npm init`

`npm install mysql2`

`npm install sequelize`

`npm install dotenv`

`npm install express`

`npm install handlebars`

`npm install express-session`

`npm install connect-session-sequelize `

## 💻Usage
  
Run the following command at the root of your project:

`mysql -u root -p`

Enter Password when promted

`source db/schema.sql`

`quit`

`npm run seed`
  
`npm start`

## Purpose

This app will allow you to blog about your favorite interests as well as interact with other blog posts. Change a boring Friday night-in watching the same series you've seen multiple times, and include High 5 into the night's events.

## Acceptance Criteria
 ` When I open the app, the Application uses a Node and Express back end and uses both GET and POST routes for retrieving and     adding new data. `
 ` When I open the root folder, the Application has a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm and uses Handlebars.js as the template engine.`
 ` When I see the backend, the Application is backed by a MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM and protects API keys and sensitive information with environment variables. `
 `When I tries to interact with the app, the Application includes user authentication (express-session and cookies). ` 
 `When I see the backend code, the Application uses at least one new library, package, or technology not covered in class. `
